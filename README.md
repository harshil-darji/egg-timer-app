# egg-timer-app
Android app that acts like a simple stopwatch.

The egg timer app loves eggs! This app for the eggs that fall asleep while studying! 

There's a scrollbar to initialise the time the stopwatch will run. The timer can be started whenever the user wants. The timer, upon ending will produce an alert sound. The timer refreshes after that, which can be used again if required.
